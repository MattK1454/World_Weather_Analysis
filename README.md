# World Weather Analysis

## Overview

This repository is setup to share data for a project where weather for cities correlating to randomly generated longitudial and latitudinal geographic coordinates, was filtered by user input and possible hotels and mock travel maps were generated using OpenWeather and Google Maps APIs.
